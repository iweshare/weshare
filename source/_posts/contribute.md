## Create Your Post

I recommend to use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to write the post, and all the site's posts are using markdown. Next, I will show you how to create your post. Let's dive into the details.

1. Use `hexo` command to create post:

   ```bash
   $ hexo new <your_post_title_name>
   ```

   After the command executed sucessfully, you can see <your_post_title_name>.md and the same name folder under the path `/source/_posts/'. Edit your post content in the markdown file, <your_post_title_name>.md, and once image or other file needed, put them under the same name folder as the post.
2. Create commit and push it.

   ```bash
   $ git add . && git commit -m 'Add a new post, <your_post_title_name>'
   $ git push -u origin master # make sure that the current branch is the lastest.
   ```

3. Create pull request to the [origin repository](https://github.com/iweshare/weshare). This is a basic usage of GitHub, I will not show the details.
   **I wish you do sync step to make your repository is the latest to the origin repository.**

**Good Luck!**
