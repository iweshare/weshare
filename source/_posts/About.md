## Quick Start

### Prerequisite

You need `git`, `node` installed on your operation system. Here, I will not give the documentation of installation. I believe that You can achieve the installation by yourself.

<div class="tip">
    The website is powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You could get some more detail from the Hexo <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/">documentation</a>, if you want to be an expert. If you encounter any problems when using Hexo, have a look at the <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide</a>.
</div>

### Install Hexo

```bash
$ npm install hexo-cli -g
```

### Clone the project and install requirements

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iweshare/weshare.git
$ cd weshare && npm install
